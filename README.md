Food waste xyz 

# Our Purpose 💭

xyz

# Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)

Users are able to input groceries.  

Users are able to browse, filter and save recipes.

# Intended Impact

The current reality of food waste and disorganization becomes a new reality where food usage is intentional, efficient, and cost-effective.  

We envision a simple system where:  
  - Food is clearly tracked by storage location
  - Expiry dates are visible and actionable
  - Waste is minimized
  - Meal planning is partially automated based on what is already available

# Target Customers🎯

Our main audience includes:
  - Home cooks and budget-conscious individuals
  - Families managing large or shared food inventories
  - Students or roommates sharing fridge and pantry space
