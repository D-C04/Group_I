# Project Introduction & Background 📝

This web application aims to reduce household food waste and aid in decision making by creating a system that provides its users with various recipes and the tools to track of food inventory whilst alerting them to food expiration dates and period.

## Business Opportunity 📍

The project will allow users to keep track of their food inventory and give user access to a variety of recipes based off said inventory, hence, assisting the users decison making on what to eat. Users will be able to adequately plan meals and maintain awareness of the quality of food in their inventory whilst also cutting food wastage and cost, eating better and healthier.

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 💻

This web application will allow for: 
* Users to input grocery items 
* Users to browse, filter and save recipes
* Notifications to users on when their items will expire

# Intended Impact 🕖

The current reality of food waste and disorganization becomes a new reality where food usage is intentional, efficient, and cost-effective.  

We envision a simple system where:  
  - Food is clearly tracked by storage location
  - Expiry dates are visible and actionable
  - Waste is minimized
  - Meal planning is partially automated based on what is already available

# Target Customers 🎯 

Our main audience includes:
  - Home cooks and budget-conscious individuals
  - Families managing large or shared food inventories
  - Students or roommates sharing fridge and pantry space
