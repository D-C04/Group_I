# Project Introduction & Background 📝

This web application aims to reduce household food waste and aid in decision making by creating a system that provides its users with various recipes and the tools to track expiration of the food they have at home.

## Business Opportunity 📍

The project will allow users to faster and easier access to a variety of recipes without scouring the web. Users will be able to adequately plan meals and maintain awareness of the quality of food in their pantry.

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 💻

This web application will allow for: 
* Users to input grocery items 
* Users to browse, filter and save recipes
* Notifications to users on when their items will expire

# Intended Impact 🕖

The current reality of food waste and disorganization becomes a new reality where food usage is intentional, efficient, and cost-effective.  

We envision a simple system where:  
  - Food is clearly tracked by storage location
  - Expiry dates are visible and actionable
  - Waste is minimized
  - Meal planning is partially automated based on what is already available

# Target Customers 🎯 

Our main audience includes:
  - Home cooks and budget-conscious individuals
  - Families managing large or shared food inventories
  - Students or roommates sharing fridge and pantry space
